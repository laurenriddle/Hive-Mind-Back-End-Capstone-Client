## What is Hive Mind?
Hive Mind is a social media platform that allows Nashville Software School students and alumni to create and share interview "surveys" for interviews that they have had with specific companies. These surveys include information that can be used by students to prepare for their own interviews with specific companies. With Hive Mind, students are able to create their own interview surveys, search for other student's interview surveys by company, save other user's surveys to a favorites board, customize personal profile information, and view other's profiles. 

## Why was Hive Mind created?
As a student who is about to graduate, when the job search process began, one thing that I quickly realized is that it can be hard to know exactly how to prepare for interviews with different companies. Each company has a different way of interviewing, different questions that they ask, and different code challenges and trying to guess the best way to prepare for these interviews can be nerve wracking. This is why I decided to create Hive Mind - a solution to ease the stress that students face during their job search by helping them feel more prepared for the interview process.
